8,1,0,"I can't understand the language, but the video doesn't show context or actual dispersion or aggression by soldiers. It could be a post-sports match event. The manipulation would be in the editing/shot composition."

10,1,4,Pyramids of Egypt or Mexico? The description doesn't match what the on-screen narrator is saying.
11,1,6,"Audio overdubbed and doesn't match the video context. Beyonce wouldn't be that ""off"" on the national anthem."

18,2,4,Pyramids of Egypt -1 hour from Mexico City! Doesn't make sense to me. Neither does the background show me anything that I usually see in the pictures shot in Egypt.
19,2,6,Hilarious!
20,2,8,"The lips didn't really synced with the words of the reporter. Maybe it was because of a bad recording, but I am not really sure of the authenticity of this video."
21,2,10,"Sounds like a planned speech. Had it been a improptu talk, it wouldn't have been so smooth while the tornado is approaching you"

51,6,7,NA
52,6,8,"The news video writes it as ""Hurricane...batters Florida"", whereas the news reader is talking about destruction in Naples, italy which is thousands of miles away from Florida. Also the location in the metadata is missing which casts further doubt."

107,13,6,This is not Beyonce's sound. It sounds so bad!

109,13,10,"The audio does not seem very synched with visuals. If the reporter is actually capturing a horrible tornado there must be more noise in the background. Also, why do we hear different reporters reporting but the visuals of different reporters are very simillar?!"
110,13,12,"Although it mentions working in the Washington state university but it says that he began his search there, maybe he decided to move to Canada afterwards to find the apple he wanted."
