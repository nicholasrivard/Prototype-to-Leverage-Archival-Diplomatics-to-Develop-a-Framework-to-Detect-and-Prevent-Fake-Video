**Abstract**
This paper is about the trustworthiness, particularly authenticity, of videos produced and posted by citizen journalists from an archival perspective. We focus first on a study that examined whether journalists could ascertain if a news video was a fake. The results of that study informed an approach to automate the assessment of a news videoâ€™s authenticity building on archival diplomatics principles and truth-finding methods. The data the study combined with authenticity criteria were then modeled into a knowledge graph model. We suggest, that graph analytics techniques, may be useful to assess the veracity of videos, as they can produce a relative authenticity score that may help computational archivists appraise the veracity of multimedia records.
